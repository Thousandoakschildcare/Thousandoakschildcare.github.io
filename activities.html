I create a nurturing environment for children to learn to interact and cooperate with one another. They learn to communicate their needs and listen to each other. We laugh a lot and generally have an energetic, playful environment. The dynamic of the group changes depending on the children and their needs.

<b>8-9</b>  The children arrive and parents give a general report on how things are going (mood, sleep, etc). We have free play, which often includes reading stories, building houses with their mat, making food in their kitchen or playing with trains.
</p>


<p>
<b>9-9:30</b> We have snack time, especially for the kids who weren't in the mood for breakfast. If a child has had a large breakfast, they continue to play while the others eat.
</p>


<p>
<b>9:30-11</b> Sometimes we will go on a walk. We like to walk up a few blocks to our neighbor's house where we can feed their chickens. Other times we play in the sand and gravel pit. If it's rainy, we try to do races inside.
</p>


<p>
<b>11-11:45</b> Art projects with the older children or if they're enjoying being outside, water table.
</p>


<p>
<b>11:45-12</b> The kids help preparing lunch, this means they will help put the plates on the table and prepare a vegetable. For example, they will shell peas or fava beans.
</p>


<p>
<b>12-1</b> Lunch time. We all sit together and talk while we eat.
</p>


<p>
<b>1-1:30</b> Free play before nap time.
</p>


<p>
<b>1:30-3:30</b> Nap time. Children who do not nap can have quiet play time.
</p>


<p>
<b>3:30-4</b> Snack time, free play as the children wake up.
</p>


<p>
<b>4-4:30</b> Story time
</p>


<p>
<b>4:30-5:30</b> Outside play as children are picked up by their parents.
